# ShaderTech - Simply Light
Adds bloom to the Simply Light mod using GregTech CEu. The bulb is a little weird and requires a [fork](https://github.com/Mpaxlamitsounas/simplylight) for bloom to work. There's also a variation with the border of edge lights removed.

Many thanks to the CEu team for the emissives implementation, and the ShaderTech team for creating the texture pack I based this off of, you can find it [here](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/ShaderTech).
